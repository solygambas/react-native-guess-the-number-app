# Guess the number

A game to understand components, styling and layout in React Native:
- guessing-game logic and random number generation
- switching between 3 screens (start game, game, game over)
- custom components (header, card, button)
- color theming with constants
- custom fonts with expo-font (AppLoading)
- custom wrapper components (TitleText, BodyText) and global styles (default-styles)
- custom icons with @expo/vector-icons
- displaying local images and online images
- styling (TextInput, nested Text, list and list items)
- using Scrollview and FlatList with flexbox
- using React Native APIs (Alert, Keyboard)
- using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
